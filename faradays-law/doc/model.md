# Expression Exchange Model Description

This is a high-level description of the model used in the Faraday's Law simulation. It it intended for audiences
that are not necessarily technical.

Qualitatively, faraday's law states that a changing magnetic field through a closed circuit induces an electromotive
force and hence a current through that circuit.  In this simulation, the user drags a bar magnet through one or two coils
and observes the current through the coils as measured by a series voltmeter.

  /**
   * The constructor config will define one or more animation "targets" (specific values to be animated). The config
   * available for targets is documented in AnimationTarget.
   *
   * If there is only one target, it is recommended to pass in those config in the top-level Animation config, e.g.:
   * | var someNumberProperty = new NumberProperty( 0 );
   * | new Animation( {
   * |   // Options for the Animation as a whole
   * |   duration: 2,
   * |
   * |   // Options for the one target to change
   * |   property: someNumberProperty,
   * |   to: 5
   * | } );
   *
   * However multiple different targets are supported, and should be specified in the `targets` option:
   * | var someNumberProperty = new NumberProperty( 100 );
   * | var someObject = { someAttribute: new Vector2( 100, 5 ) };
   * | new Animation( {
   * |   // Options for the Animation as a whole
   * |   duration: 2,
   * |
   * |   targets: [ {
   * |     // First target
   * |     property: someNumberProperty,
   * |     to: 5
   * |   }, {
   * |     // Second target
   * |     object: someObject,
   * |     attribute: 'someAttribute',
   * |     to: new Vector2( 50, 10 )
   * |   } ]
   * | } );
   *
   * NOTE: The length of the animation needs to be specified in exactly one place. This can usually be done by
   * specifying the `duration` in the config, but `speed` can also be used in any of the targets.
   *
   * EXAMPLE: It's possible to create continuous animation loops, where animations cycle back and forth, e.g.:
   * | var moreOpaque = new Animation( {
   * |   object: animatedCircle,
   * |   attribute: 'opacity',
   * |   from: 0.5,
   * |   to: 1,
   * |   duration: 0.5,
   * |   easing: Easing.QUADRATIC_IN_OUT
   * | } );
   * | var lessOpaque = new Animation( {
   * |   object: animatedCircle,
   * |   attribute: 'opacity',
   * |   from: 1,
   * |   to: 0.5,
   * |   duration: 0.5,
   * |   easing: Easing.QUADRATIC_IN_OUT
   * | } );
   * | moreOpaque.then( lessOpaque );
   * | lessOpaque.then( moreOpaque );
   * | lessOpaque.start();

## Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's law  defines the force that two charges will exert upon each other.

F = k( q1 * q2 / r<sup>2</sup>)

where:

F = the force on each charge<br>
k = Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10<sup>9</sup> Nm<sup>2</sup>C<sup>-2</sup>)<br>
q1 = the charge *left* object<br>
q2 = the charge *right* object<br>
r = the distance between the charges

## Gravitational Force
Gravitation describes the attractive force between two point masses.

F = G( m1 * m2 / r<sup>2</sup>)

where:

F = the force on each mass<br>
G = the gravitational constant (6.674 x 10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>)<br>
m1 = the mass *left* object<br>
m2 = the mass *right* object<br>
r = the distance between the masses
